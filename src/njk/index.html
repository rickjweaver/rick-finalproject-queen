      "Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. 
      Their classic line-up was <a href="freddiemercury.html">Freddie Mercury</a> (lead vocals and piano), 
      <a href="brianmay.html">Brian May</a> (lead guitar and vocals), <a href="rogertaylor.html">Roger Taylor</a> (drums and vocals), 
      and <a href="johndeacon.html">John Deacon</a> (bass guitar). Their earliest works were influenced by 
      progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually 
      ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating 
      further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music."
